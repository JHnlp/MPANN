{"pmid": "33108074", "pmcid": "", "title": "The incidence and clinical effects of Bordetella pertussis in children hospitalized with acute bronchiolitis.", "abstractText": "BACKGROUND\nPertussis is a disease leading to high morbidity and mortality in neonates and infants. Bronchiolitis is the most common cause of hospitalization especially in children < 2 year-old. Although the clinical findings are different in these two diseases, it is sometimes difficult to make this distinction in partially or fully vaccinated children. This study aimed to identify the incidence, clinical and laboratory effects of B. pertussis as a causative agent in hospitalized children with acute bronchiolitis.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe study included patients diagnosed with acute bronchiolitis and admitted to the Division of Pediatric Infectious Diseases from January 2012 to December 2015, aged 24 months or younger, evaluated for viruses and bacteria with polymerase chain reaction in respiratory tract secretions.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe study included 380 patients hospitalized with acute bronchiolitis. Of these patients, 85.8% were identified to be positive for at least one respiratory pathogen. The most commonly identified pathogens were respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) A/B, rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, bocavirus and metapneumovirus A/B. B. pertussis was only detected in 5 patients (1.5%). In the patients with B. pertussis identified, coinfection with another virus was observed including rhinovirus (n= 2), influenza A virus (n= 1), coronavirus OC43 (n= 1) and RSV A/B (n= 1). The presence of B. pertussis did not appear to cause any significant clinical or laboratory differences in patients.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nB. pertussis is a rare pathogen in patients admitted to hospital for acute bronchiolitis. However, in patients who do not respond to standard bronchiolitis treatment, B. pertussis should be considered as a causative agent. Early identification of this pathogen is important in terms of quarantining the patient, administering appropriate antimicrobial treatment, and prophylactic treatment to household and other close contacts.", "meshMajor": ["Bordetella pertussis", "Bronchiolitis", "Cohort Studies", "Female", "Hospitalization", "Humans", "Incidence", "Infant", "Male", "Whooping Cough"], "labels": ["D001886", "D001988", "D015331", "D005260", "D006760", "D006801", "D015994", "D007223", "D008297", "D014917"], "authors": "E Efendiyeva;TT Kara;T Erat;A Yahşi;A Karbuz;BA Kocabaş;H Özdemir;ZC Karahan;E İnce;E Çiftçi", "journal": "The Turkish journal of pediatrics", "medline_ta": "Turk J Pediatr", "affiliations": "Department of Pediatrics, Ankara University Faculty of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey.;Division of Pediatric Infectious Diseases, Ankara University Faculty of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey.;Division of Pediatric Infectious Diseases, Ankara University Faculty of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey.;Division of Pediatric Infectious Diseases, Ankara University Faculty of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey.;Division of Pediatric Infectious Diseases, Ankara University Faculty of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey.;Division of Pediatric Infectious Diseases, Ankara University Faculty of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey.;Division of Pediatric Infectious Diseases, Ankara University Faculty of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey.;Department of Medical Microbiology, Ankara University Faculty of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey.;Division of Pediatric Infectious Diseases, Ankara University Faculty of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey.;Division of Pediatric Infectious Diseases, Ankara University Faculty of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey.", "keywords": "Bordetella pertussis; acute bronchiolitis; hospitalized children; incidence", "year": "2020", "chemical_list": "", "doi": "10.24953/turkjped.2020.05.003", "url": "https://doi.org/10.24953/turkjped.2020.05.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33108074/", "bodyText": ""}

Patients on dialysis are considered to be at increased risk for infection due to their medical comorbidities and need for continued face-to-face encounters in dialysis units. In our outpatient dialysis practice, 42 out of 269 patients (15.6%) were infected with COVID-19 during the first wave of the pandemic. In this retrospective report, we review issues of infection control, access to interventional procedures, and communication encountered in our practice. We discuss lessons learned in patient outcomes and the importance of transitioning patients to home modalities. Further planning for a potential second wave of COVID-19 may help ensure improved quality of care for patients in the dialysis program.", "meshMajor": ["Ambulatory Care", "COVID-19", "Coronavirus Infections", "Humans", "Infection Control", "Pandemics", "Pneumonia, Viral", "Renal Dialysis", "Retrospective Studies", "United States"], "labels": ["D000553", "D000086382", "D018352", "D006801", "D017053", "D058873", "D011024", "D006435", "D012189", "D014481"], "authors": "E Noce;M Zorzanello;D Patel;R Kodali", "journal": "Nephrology nursing journal : journal of the American Nephrology Nurses' Association", "medline_ta": "Nephrol Nurs J", "affiliations": "Nurse Practitioner, Yale-New Haven Hospital, Department of Internal Medicine, Section of Nephrology, New Haven, CTn.;Nurse Practitioner, Yale University, Department of Medicine, Section of Nephrology, New Haven, CT.;Nephrology Fellow, Yale University, Department of Medicine, Section of Nephrology, New Haven, CT.;Instructor of Medicine, Yale University, Department of Medicine, Section of Nephrology, New Haven, CT.", "keywords": "COVID-19; hemodialysis; infection control; pandemic", "year": "2020", "chemical_list": "", "doi": "", "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33107714/", "bodyText": ""}
