## CovSI Corpus

This description is mainly about the [COVID-19 Semantic Indexing (CovSI) Corpus](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11Z0v_q2m0Tsvc-hsQJZM6hckw_u87bEi/view?usp=sharing). The corpus is designed for the
semantic indexing research in COVID-19 domain.

## Corpus Construction

The corpus is constructed mainly based on three large resources of [CORD-19](https://allenai.org/data/cord-19)
, [MEDLINE](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), and [PMC](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/).

As the [COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19)](https://allenai.org/data/cord-19) provides the largest dataset of
COVID-19 relevant articles, it is natural to be considered the fundamental resource For [CovSI](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11Z0v_q2m0Tsvc-hsQJZM6hckw_u87bEi/view?usp=sharing) due to its large coverage
and public accessibility. However, although CORD-19 carries lots of fundamental ingredients, it doesnâ€™t provide any
relevant annotations for semantic indexing. Therefore, databases of [MEDLINE](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/)
and [PMC](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/) are considered as the preferred supplementation.

In this regard, all kinds of attribute fields are first extracted from these resources, then the redundant information
is filtered and the reserved metadata is mapped. All extracted metadata is finally merged to construct the corpus of
[CovSI](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11Z0v_q2m0Tsvc-hsQJZM6hckw_u87bEi/view?usp=sharing) for COVID-19 semanticn indexing. Note that during the corpus construction, PMIDs/PMCIDs are treated as the unique
identifiers for articles, and the articles without valid PMIDs or PMCIDs would be discarded.

The [CovSI](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11Z0v_q2m0Tsvc-hsQJZM6hckw_u87bEi/view?usp=sharing) corpus is stored in the JSON format, consisting of ~87k COVID-19 related articles.
